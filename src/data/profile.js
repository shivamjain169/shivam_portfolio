   about: [
    'I’m a Full-stack developer with over 3 years of experience building scalable React and FastAPI-based platforms focused on performance, reliability, and real-time user experiences.',
    'My work centers on measurable outcomes-reducing CPU workloads by 35-40%, optimizing database queries by up to 50%, and improving frontend performance by around 30% through architectural and performance-focused improvements.',
    'I have hands-on experience designing microservices architectures, real-time WebSocket pipelines, and AI-assisted workflows for automating complex, previously manual processes.',
    'I strongly value clean architecture, observability, and long-term maintainability. I actively leverage AI-assisted development tools such as GitHub Copilot and Cursor to accelerate development while maintaining high code quality and system reliability.',
    'My approach combines technical depth with business impact: every system I build is designed to scale, perform, and solve real-world problems effectively.'
